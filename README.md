# BLUETOOTH-RC-CAR-ARDUINO-
HELLO
THIS IS MY FIRST ARDUINO PROJECT
A BLUETOOTH APP CONTROLLED CAR
I HAVE ALSO MADE MY FIRST ANDROID APP USING MIT APP DEVELOPER
IN THIS PROJECT I HAVE USED :-
TWO SERVO MOTORS,
ARDUINO UNO,
MOTOR DRIVR(IC L293D), and
BLUETOOTH MODULE
THIS HAS A BASIC FUNCTIONALITY OF A CAR
THINGS TO BE ADDED IN FUTURE -
AUTOMATIC WIPERS WHICH WILL INITIATE ON CONTACT WITH WATER
ULTRASOUND EMITTER WHICH WILL STOP THE CAR AUTOMATICALLY WHEN OBJECT IS FOUND AT A CERTAIN DISTANCE
INFRARED SENSOR.
....AND MUCH MORE TO COME

THANK YOU !!
